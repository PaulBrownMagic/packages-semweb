* Add default_ns(Name) to rdf_save/2.

* Add indexing on source, to speedup saving a particular source as well as
  rdf_retractall(_,_,_,Src).

LITERALS AS FIRST CLASS CITIZENS:
=================================

Step 1: making them into distinct objects.

	* V0 (before distinct objects, using Artchive database)
		# Triples: 3918374
		Memory: 254 MB
		Initial image (after ?- triple20): 905MB

Step 2: sharing

	* Use atom-set to index on resource/string/etc.
	* Remove literals from tree if last references is gone
	* Ensure fast reclaim on rdf_reset_db.
