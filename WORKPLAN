---+ Concurrent RDF workplan

  * Establish triple-GC

  * Establish expansion of triple hash-tables [OK]

  * Remove old locking code.

  * Establish compatible broadcasting

  * Reconsider handling of duplicate triples.  The problem:
    We have a set of triples with different life-span.  We must return
    one triple as long as the set is not empty for our query
    generation.

    - Old solution: assign a leader.  This is now unfeasible (I think)
    - New solution:
      - Maintain duplicate status, indicating that a predicate MAY have
        duplicates.
      - Maintain db (hash) of produced triples, avoiding dublicates.
    - Alternative:
      - Have source-location chain on each triple.  Source location must
        have a generation!




  * Deal with subPropertyOf predicate clouds

  * Test framework
    - Controlled concurrency
    - Stress testing
