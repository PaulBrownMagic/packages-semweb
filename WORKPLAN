---+ Concurrent RDF workplan

  * Establish triple-GC						[OK]

  * Establish expansion of triple hash-tables			[OK]

  * Remove old locking code.					[OK]

  * Establish compatible broadcasting

  * Duplicate suppression by maintaining a table of duplicate
    answers.							[OK]

  * Deal with subPropertyOf predicate clouds			[OK]

  * Cleanup reachability matrices in GC.  Fairly trivial: just delete
    them if their lifespan has passed.  Except for concurrency issues,
    we do not have to be cautious because they will be recreated anyway.

    - When creating a matrix (for an older generation?), it must invalidate
      at the right time!  This should be the nearest born/died
      generation of the predicates in the cloud.

  * Test framework
    - Controlled concurrency (test_con.pl).  How to generate a comprehensive
      set of test-cases?

      - Action grammar to generate sequences?
      - Keep shadow admin in Prolog
      - Formalise transaction/snapshot isolation

    - Stress testing
      - Run controlled tests concurrently in transactions?
